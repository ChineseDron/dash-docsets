   The PHP safe mode is an attempt to solve the shared-server security
   problem. It is architecturally incorrect to try to solve this
   problem at the PHP level, but since the alternatives at the web
   server and OS levels aren&#039;t very realistic, many people,
   especially ISP&#039;s, use safe mode for now.

Note that safe mode is largely useless. Most ISPs that offer Perl also offer other scripting languages (mostly Perl), and these other languages don't have the equivalent of PHP.<br />
In other words, if PHP's safe mode won't allow vandals into your web presence, they will simply use Perl.<br />
Also, safe mode prevents scripts from creating and using directories (because they will be owned by the WWW server, not by the user who uploaded the PHP script). So it's not only useless, it's also a hindrance.<br />
The only realistic option is to bugger the Apache folks until they run all scripts as the user who's responsible for a given virtualhost or directory.</span>

Safe mode is used "since the alternatives at the web server and OS levels aren't very realistic". Manual says about UNIX OS level and UNIX web-servers by design (Apache). It's not realistic for unix-like server, but for NT (IIS) each virtual host can run from different user account, so there is no need in Safe Mode restrictions at all, if proper NTFS rights are set.</span>

Beware that when in safe mode, mkdir creates folders with apache's UID, though the files you create in them are of your script's UID (usually the same as your FTP uid).<br />
<br />
What this means is that if you create a folder, you won't be able to remove it, nor to remove any of the files you've created in it (because those operations require the UID to be the same).<br />
<br />
Ideally mkdir should create the folder with the script's UID, but this has already been discussed and will not be fixed in the near future. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I would advice NOT to user mkdir in safe mode, as you may end up with folders you can't remove/use.</span>

zebz: The user would not be able to create a directory outside the namespace where he/she would be able to modify its contents. One can't create a directory that becomes apache-owned unless one owns the parent directory.<br />
<br />
Another security risk: since files created by apache are owned by apache, a user could call the fputs function and output PHP code to a newly-created file with a .php extension, thus creating an apache-owned PHP script on the server. Executing that apache-owned script would allow the script to work with files in the apache user's namespace, such as logs. A solution would be to force PHP-created files to be owned by the same owner/group as the script that created them. Using open_basedir would be a likely workaround to prevent ascension into uncontrolled areas.</span>

Some paranoid web managers also restrict the set_user_abort() function.<br />
<br />
This constitutes a security issue for hosted web sites, because the hosted script cannot guarantee safe atomic operations on files in a reasonnable time (the time limit may still be in effect):<br />
<br />
If set_user_abort() is disabled by the web admin, a user can corrupt the files of a hosted web site by simply sending many requests to the PHP script, and aborting it fast. In some cases that can be easily reproduced after a dozen of attempts, the script will be interrupted in the middle of a file or database update!<br />
<br />
The only way for the hosted web site to protect itself in this case is to use a sleep() with a random but not null short time before performing atomic operations.<br />
<br />
Web admins should then definitely NOT disable the set_user_abort() function which is vital to ensure atomic operations on hosted critical files or databases.<br />
<br />
Instead they should only disable the set_time_limit() function, and set a constant but reasonnable time for any script to complete their atomic operations.</span>

disk_free_space($directory) is also restricted by the safe_mode ! It can also be completely forbidden as this would allow a script to test the available space in order to fill it with a giant file, preventing other scripts to use that space (notably in "/tmp").<br />
disk_free_space() is then informational, and this does not prevent system quotas to limit the size of your files to a value lower than the available free space!<br />
Most web server admins that propose PHP hosting, will implement quotas for your hosting account, but also on any shared resources such as temporary folders.</span>

open_basedir only restricts file operations to files and directories under a specified directory, but you can still user system ("vi /home/somedir/somefile"), so safe_mode still has a place here as it is much more restrictive then open_basedir.<br />
<br />
Also, to reply to someone who said that 'above' and 'below' was a matter of perspective, sure it is. Of course, a file is not under another one, etc, it just pointed by some inode. But in the common language we consider the root (/) to be above everything else, and /home is below root, and /home/myfile is below /home. There is no written standard, but most people (those I know anyway) agree on that syntax.</span>

All the filesystem-related functions (unlink, fopen, unlink, etc) seems to be restricted the same way in safe mode, at least on PHP 4.2. If the file UID is different *but* the directory (where the file is located) UID is the same, it will work.<br />
<br />
So creating a directory in safe mode is usually a bad idea since the UID will be different from the script (it will be the apache UID) so it won't be possible to do anything with the files created on this directory.</span>

Many filesystem-related functions are not appropriately restricted when Safe Mode is activated on an NT server it seems.&nbsp; I would assume that this is due to the filesystem not making use of UID.<br />

In all of my scripts, no matter WHO owns the script (file Ownership-wise) or WHO owns the directory/file in question; both UIDs display<br />
<br />
(getmyuid() and fileowner()) as UID = 0<br />
<br />
This has the rather nasty side effect of Safe Mode allowing multiple filesystem operations because it believes the script owner and file/dir owner are one and the same.<br />

While this can be worked around by the judicious application of proper filesystem privileges, it's still a "dud" that many of Safe Mode's securities are simply not there with an NT implementation.</span>
