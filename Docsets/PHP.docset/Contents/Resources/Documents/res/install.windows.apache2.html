Apache 2.2 crashing on WindowsXP/Apache2.2/php5.3.8_Win32.VC9-x86<br />
<br />
There is a distinction between LoadFile and LoadModule.<br />
<br />
LoadModule is typically used to load&nbsp; Shared Objects (.so), and comes in very handy for Dynamically Shared Objects<br />
LoadFile on windows it typically used to load DLL<br />
<br />
Please note:&nbsp; In order for a LoadMoudle directive to work on a DLL the module must be compiled into the library.&nbsp; If you use VI you can usually locate the module, but the file is compiled, don't write it!<br />
<br />
A dll can be located anywhere on the system.<br />
A .so should be located in your Apache install modules folder.<br />
<br />
What worked for me for Windows XP/Apache2.2/php5.3.8_Win32.VC9-x86<br />
<br />
PHPIniDir "C:/PHP/"<br />
LoadFile "C:/PHP/libeay32.dll"<br />

If you are having problems with php5ts.dll...<br />
<br />
php5ts.dll is php5.dll but thread safe, hence the 'ts' at the end.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Software Details:<br />
MySQL&nbsp; 5.5<br />
PHP 5.2.17 VC6 Non-thread safe<br />
Apache 2.2.19<br />
Win XP SP3<br />
<br />
Here's how I fixed the problem:<br />
<br />
I've been looking online on how to integrate Apache with PHP right so I come across this code to put in my httpd.conf apache configuration file:<br />
<br />
LoadModule php5_module "C:/php/php5apache2_2.dll"<br />
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php<br />
PhpIniDir "C:/php"<br />
<br />
I paste it in a voila! it crashes!&nbsp; I know its not news, but I looked and lo and behold its that darn php5ts.dll file!<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
I installed PHP 5.2.17 VC6 Non-Thread Safe.&nbsp; I then installed the PHP 5.2.17 VC6 thread safe so I could copy these files from the thread safe installation into the PHP 5.2.17 VC6 Non-Thread safe installation directory:<br />
<br />
php5apache2_2.dll<br />
php5apache2_2filter.dll<br />
<br />
Not sure if that last file is needed but I added it anyway.<br />
<br />
Then I uninstalled the thread safe installation.<br />
<br />
The Apache service started right up.<br />
<br />
Had some problems with MySQL too:<br />
<br />
When I installed it the first time it was fine.&nbsp; Then I uninstalled it and got that "Service could not be started Error: 0" message.<br />
<br />
To do a complete deletion do this:<br />
<br />
1) Use MySQLInstanceconfig.exe to remove the service<br />
2) Use the "Add/Remove programs" to uninstall MySQL<br />
3) Delete the "c:\program files\MySQL directory"<br />
4) Delete the "c:\documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\MySql\" directory<br />
5) Launch regedit.exe from START&gt;RUN and press ctrl+f for the find function and type in MYSQL to find and get rid of anything "MySQL" in there.&nbsp; Press F3 to find repeat instances of "MySQL"<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you.&nbsp; I spent about 30hrs uninstalling and reinstalling this crap...</span>

Here is yet another aspect of the "faulting module php5ts.dll" crash when trying to start apache.<br />
I installed Apache 2.2.18, Mysql 5.1.57 and PHP 5.2.17 (apache module, VC6 thread-safe - initially with no extensions) on a fresh WinXP SP3 system. The versions chosen were because I was trying to replicate as near as possible apps on my Linux server.<br />
<br />
Everything configured and ran properly without php extensions, so I then reran the msi installer and chose the necessary extensions.&nbsp; I reconfigured httpd.conf&nbsp; but apache then just kept crashing.<br />
Eventually I came across the "fix" mentioned elsewhere "copy libmysql.dll to apache folder" and suddenly it worked. But why? I checked and the php installation folder was in the system path. The answer was simply that I had never rebooted. It seems that whatever process controls windows services only reads the path at boot time.&nbsp; I was thrown by assuming that if I started httpd from the command line then it would inherit that path.<br />
<br />
Here are a few diagnostic tips that helped me along the way:<br />
<br />
Try the CLI command:<br />
php -m<br />
and see that the command line version loads all the modules you asked for.<br />
<br />
in php.ini, enable <br />
display_errors = On<br />
and<br />
display_startup_errors = On<br />
The latter pops up a window saying which extension it has trouble loading. Of course it is not perfectly clear, because it says something like 'unable to load "C:\php\ext\php_mysql.dll" - The specified module could not be found'. It lies - it really does find that dll, but it must have failed on the dependency of libmysql.dll.</span>

Nothing worked. I was tearing my hair out and ready to cry.&nbsp; I have set this up numerous times on XP with no problem.&nbsp; But on Win 7 Pro it wasn't happening.<br />

If Apache won't start after PHP install, check for this scenario:<br />
<br />
When I followed the instructions for the Windows installer, using Apache HTTP server 2.2.17, the install completed normally but Apache would then fail to start. It turned out that the installer was not properly configuring the last section of Apache's httpd.conf file:<br />
<br />
#BEGIN PHP INSTALLER EDITS - REMOVE ONLY ON UNINSTALL<br />
PHPIniDir "c:/php/"<br />
LoadModule php5_module "c:/php/php5apache2_2.dll"<br />
#END PHP INSTALLER EDITS - REMOVE ONLY ON UNINSTALL<br />

The text above is the correct configuration (in my case, I had asked the installer to place PHP into directory C:/PHP.)&nbsp; However, the installer omitted the string "c:/php/" from the two lines above where you can see them.

I wanted to install PHP5.3 for Apache2.2 with PostgreSql 9.0 support on WindowsXP. It took me hours to solve it. <br />
<br />
The following possible problems occur:<br />
- You should use the VC6-compiled version of php instead of VC9. The later one does not work properly with apache.<br />
- the postgres handler dlls are not working in PHP5.3. <br />
<br />
The symptom was a misleading and very confusing error message:<br />
<br />
Unable to load dynamic library 'c:\Progra~1\PHP\ext\php_pgsql.dll'<br />
<br />
The dll itself was there but when it started to load the other dll (libpq.dll) from the php directory then this caused an error. This error was misinterpreted internally in the above message.<br />
<br />
The solution was NOT to use the libpq.dll from php but use it from postgres distribution instead. <br />
<br />
For this purpose I inserted the following line into the apache httpd conf:<br />
<br />
LoadFile "C:/Progra~1/PostgreSQL/9.0/bin/libpq.dll"<br />
<br />
This preloads the dll. When php_pgsql.dll would load his own libpq.dll, then there is the preloaded version of this file in the memory already. This prevents us from using the bad version of dll.<br />
<br />
I hope I helped.</span>

After using the Windows installer for Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.3.2, and installing PHP as an Apache module (not CGI), Apache would crash and fail to start. There were two problems with the configuration files for Apache and PHP.<br />
<br />
First, make sure your Apache configuration file reads something similar to:<br />
<br />
LoadModule php5_module "C:/Program Files/PHP/php5apache2_2.dll"<br />
PHPIniDir "C:/Program Files/PHP/"<br />
<br />
While other users have disabled some or all of the MySQL extensions to prevent all three from running at the same time, I have all of them enabled. However, I do not have PostgreSQL, so I needed to comment out loading the php_pgsql.dll in my php.ini file, as follows:<br />
<br />
;[PHP_PGSQL]<br />
;extension=php_pgsql.dll<br />
<br />
This stopped Apache from crashing and started successfully.</span>

If you find that Apache crashes when you attempt to start it, its likely that one of the PHP extensions is the cause. This is likely the case if you use the PHP Windows installer and choose all extensions in the setup program to be installed on disk. Unfortunately, it will also enable all extensions too causing potential problems.<br />
<br />
For example, after installing PHP 5.2.11 and Apache 2.2 under Windows XP, Apache kept crashing. This was due to using all three versiosn of mysql extensions attempting to run:<br />
<br />
[PHP_MYSQL]<br />
extension=php_mysql.dll<br />
[PHP_MYSQLI]<br />
extension=php_mysqli.dll<br />
[PHP_PDO_MYSQL]<br />

This is old news to some. But people with Apache 2.0.55 / PHP 5.1.2 might like a reminder before they pull their hair out! (Some of us have ISPs using older version and need to test on a like version before we upload.)<br />
<br />
If using PHP 5.1.2, to run Apache as a module, do *not* use Stephan's "php5apache2.dll" from <a href="http://www.ApacheLounge.com. That is for pre-5.1.2!" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ApacheLounge.com. That is for pre-5.1.2!</a><br />
<br />
**There is a "php5apache2.dll" included with Windows PHP 5.1.2 zip file by default.**<br />
<br />
If you forget this and overwrite the included DLL with Stephan's (as I did) you'll spend hours attempting to escape "DLL hell", with no success.</span>

If you install PHP as an Apache CGI binary, you can add: <br />
AddHandler cgi-script .php<br />

#!php<br />
<span class="default">&lt;?php<br />
phpinfo</span><span class="keyword">();<br />
</span><span class="default">?&gt;<br />

In fact, you do NOT need to add shebang line to every PHP script even if you install PHP as an Apache CGI binary, because you can add: <br />
ScriptInterpreterSource Registry-Strict<br />
into Apache httpd.conf, and make the registry file and merge it like: <br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.php\Shell\ExecCGI\Command]<br />
@="\"C:\\Program Files\\PHP\\php-cgi.exe\""<br />

Verrrrrrrry important note:<br />

If you enable multi-byte strings for your installation of PHP, the extension loaded MUST be the first extension in the list.<br />

Apache, NOR PHP will generate any error messages or warning information in the error log or in system logs about this.<br />

You should change the path as in your system. The directive LoadModule php5_module seems a bit strange to you. It should be LoadModule php6_module instead.

This is likely caused by read permissions not being set correctly on NTFS file systems, however, it has occurred when no cause could be identified.
