    This program is extremely simple and you really did not need to use
    PHP to create a page like this. All it does is display:
    <i>Hello World</i> using the PHP <span class="function"><a href="function.echo.html" class="function">echo()</a></span>
    statement. Note that the file <em class="emphasis">does not need to be executable</em>
    or special in any way. The server finds out that this file needs to be interpreted
    by PHP because you used the &quot;.php&quot; extension, which the server is configured
    to pass on to PHP. Think of this as a normal HTML file which happens to have
    a set of special tags available to you that do a lot of interesting things.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    If you tried this example and it did not output anything, it prompted 
    for download, or you see the whole file as text, chances are that the 
    server you are on does not have PHP enabled, or is not configured properly.
    Ask your administrator to enable it for you using the
    <a href="install.html" class="link">Installation</a> chapter 
    of the manual. If you are developing locally, also read the
    installation chapter to make sure everything is configured
    properly. Make sure that you access the file via http with the server
    providing you the output. If you just call up the file from your file
    system, then it will not be parsed by PHP. If the problems persist anyway,
    do not hesitate to use one of the many
    <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external" title="Link : http://www.php.net/support.php">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP support</a> options.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format.
    In this example we used <i>&lt;?php</i> to indicate the
    start of a PHP tag. Then we put the PHP statement and left PHP mode by
    adding the closing tag, <i>?&gt;</i>. You may jump in
    and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this anywhere you want.  For more
    details, read the manual section on the <a href="language.basic-syntax.html" class="link">
    basic PHP syntax</a>.

    <p class="para">
     Line feeds have little meaning in HTML, however it is still a good idea
     to make your HTML look nice and clean by putting line feeds in.  A
     linefeed that follows immediately after a closing
     <i>?&gt;</i> will be removed by PHP.  This can be extremely
     useful when you are putting in many blocks of PHP or include files
     containing PHP that aren&#039;t supposed to output anything.  At the same time
     it can be a bit confusing.  You can put a space after the closing
     <i>?&gt;</i> to force a space and a line feed to be output,
     or you can put an explicit line feed in the last echo/print from within
     your PHP block.

     If you are writing your PHP scripts using Windows Notepad, you will need
     to ensure that your files are saved with the <var class="filename">.php</var> extension.
     (Notepad adds a <var class="filename">.txt</var> extension to files automatically unless
     you take one of the following steps to prevent it.)  When you save the file and
     are prompted to provide a name for the file, place the filename in quotes 
     (i.e. &quot;<var class="filename">hello.php</var>&quot;).  Alternatively, you can click on the

Well, but PHP file ownership is important when server has safe_mode enabled - HTTP server checks it, uses it to set UID of process which executes it, or may even refuse to execute such a file - e.g. if one user is owner of main PHP file, and the main file includes another, owned by other user, this is considered to be security violation (quite reasonably).</span>

On Windows, if file extensions can be hidden, you may not SEE that you have accidently saved a file as 'Text Documents' (and that the browser has added '.txt' to the end of your 'page.html', resulting in 'page.html.txt'.) You still see only 'page.html' even though it's really 'page.html.txt'. Also, if you try to rename it, it won't work because it's not overwriting the '.txt' part and not changing the filetype.<br />
<br />
By the way, the hiding of file extensions is ALSO a way malicious crackers get you to click on an executable virus, fooling you into thinking it's an innocent document. You should always be able to view the extensions of all files on your system.<br />
<br />
To view all extensions, open Windows Explorer. Click the 'Tools' menu, then 'Folder Options'. In the dialog box that appears, click the 'View' tab. In the 'Advanced Settings Box', scroll down to 'Hide extensions for known file types' and click the checkbox next to it to REMOVE THE CHECKMARK. Click the 'Apply to All Folders' button near the top of the dialog. This may or may not take a few minutes. Then click the 'OK' button to close the dialog.<br />
<br />
Now, if something accidentally gets saved as the wrong filetype, resulting in another file extension automatically appended to the one you typed, you will see it and be able to rename it.<br />
<br />
Of course, a badly-named file can be renamed simply by using 'Save As' and saving it as the proper filetype, but if you can't see the file extension, you may not know that is the problem. Also, renaming is easier than opening, resaving as a new filetype, and then deleting the old version!</span>

You can associate the .php file extension w/ Windows w/o going into the registry.<br />
<br />
Open up My Computer or MSIE in file mode. Go to folder options &gt; File types tab. Now click new. Add the extension as PHP or php. If you can't find the PHP application in the dropdown list under advanced, just go OK, for now. At least the extension is in place.<br />
<br />
Now, try and create a php file by using the directions from this page of the PHP tutorial (should save it with the rest of your HTML files, i.e. your DocumentRoot). If you go to view your php file listed in the directory, and you see that it's still a .txt file, right-click the icon to see if you can locate "open with." If so, you should be able to browse for the appropriate file, which should be at (may vary, depending on where you installed PHP):<br />
<br />
C:\PHP\php.exe<br />
<br />
Click that as the default program, and the PHP logo should appear on all your scripts, and no problems saving should occur w/ any program.<br />
